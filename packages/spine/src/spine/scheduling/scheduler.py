"""
The clock, split from the job -- generalized (CHN-33 extraction of
P1's publishing/scheduler.py, CHN-17's own original framing).

"A button labelled 'run the digest' is a test harness, not a
scheduler." Everything this module decides -- is a given schedule due
right now -- is expressed as one pure function, is_due(spec, moment),
that takes the moment as an ordinary argument rather than reading a
clock itself. That is the entire "clock override for demos" mechanism:
a demo calls is_due(spec, moment) with whatever moment it wants to
pretend it is, and gets exactly the same decision production would
make at that real moment -- no fake clock, no monkeypatched datetime,
no APScheduler internals to fight.

build_scheduler() is the real production wiring: one real APScheduler
CronTrigger per schedule, firing at that schedule's own configured
local time, on its own configured working days, in its own timezone.
APScheduler (not this module) is what tracks wall-clock time in
production; build_scheduler() only translates a ScheduleSpec into the
CronTrigger fields that make APScheduler fire at the same moments
is_due() would say yes to.

GENERALIZED FROM P1's ORIGINAL (which took a concrete ChannelConfig and
hardcoded a call to run_daily_digest_job): this version knows nothing
about digests, channels, or Teams. It takes a ScheduleSpec (five plain
fields any agent's config can produce) and any job_fn/job_kwargs pair.
P1's own publishing/scheduler.py is now a thin wrapper: it defines how
to turn a ChannelConfig into a ScheduleSpec and how to build
run_daily_digest_job's kwargs, and calls this module's build_scheduler
with those two functions. A future agent with its own config shape and
its own job function does the same, without touching this file.
