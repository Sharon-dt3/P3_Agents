"""
SPN-08: the proposal record and status machine (Shared).

"The core abstraction of all three agents. Build once, well." -- this
task's own rationale. Every outbound action any of the three agents
ever proposes -- a digest, a nudge, an escalation, a P2 tracker update,
a P3 backlog change -- becomes exactly one row here before anything is
ever sent anywhere. Nothing in this module sends, posts, or publishes
anything; that is SPN-09's write guard and each capability's own
publish adapter. This module only answers two questions: what did the
model actually propose, and what, if anything, is a human allowed to
do to that proposal next.

Two guarantees this record makes, both load-bearing for HITL gating
across all three agents:

1. original_model_output is captured once, at create(), and never
   written to again by anything in this module. payload starts equal
   to it but is the field a human's edit is allowed to replace, at
   approve() time. So "what the model said" and "what was actually
   approved and applied" are always two independently readable
   answers, never one overwriting the other -- this task's own
   acceptance test in one sentence.

2. status is a small explicit state machine, not a free-text field a
   caller can set to anything: pending can only become approved or
   rejected; approved can only become applied; rejected and applied
   are terminal. An illegal move (approving something already decided,
   applying something never approved) raises rather than silently
   succeeding -- the record-level half of approval gating. SPN-09 adds
   the service-layer half (refusing the underlying write itself, not
   just the status column), for the same reason SPN-06's grounding
   kernel and CHN-13's daily summary are two separate layers of the
   same guarantee rather than one doing both jobs.

create() is idempotent on idempotency_key the same way every other
store in this codebase upserts on reprocessing -- but unlike
DigestStore (where re-generating a not-yet-published digest safely
overwrites its content), a retried create() here must never reset an
already-decided proposal back to a fresh pending row, so it returns the
existing row untouched rather than overwriting anything. See
DECISION_LOG.md.
