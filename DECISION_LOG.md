# Decision Log

Format: date, decision, context/reasoning, alternatives considered.

## 2026-09-15 -- Project tooling: uv over docker-compose

Decision: Use uv for environment/dependency management rather than docker-compose.

Context/reasoning: uv gives a single, fast, reproducible install command (uv sync) with a committed lockfile, satisfying SPN-01's "one install command" requirement without container-orchestration overhead for a single-service Python project.

Alternatives considered: docker-compose -- rejected at this stage as unnecessary overhead; may be reconsidered if the project later needs to bundle non-Python services locally.

## 2026-09-15 -- SQLite over a hosted database

Decision: Use SQLite (with FTS5) as the system of record, per SPN-04.

Context/reasoning: Zero setup, reproducible in a clean clone with no external service, and the schema stays readable in the repo as committed migration files.

Alternatives considered: A hosted Postgres/Dataverse-backed store -- rejected as system of record; Dataverse is added later purely as a human-editable config surface (CHN-02/CHN-25), never the source of truth.

## 2026-09-15 -- CHN-01: Microsoft Graph access spike

Decision: Pursue Option A -- delegated ChannelMessage.Read.All via a dedicated
service account added as a member of each allowlisted channel, rather than
Option B (application permission).

Context/reasoning: Option A does not require Microsoft's Teams-export
protected-API approval, only tenant admin consent -- a materially lower bar
than Option B, which needs both admin consent and Microsoft's protected-API
approval, and may be metered. Option A also bounds the app's reach to
whichever channels the service account actually joins, rather than granting
tenant-wide read access.

Actions taken:
- Registered Azure AD app p1-teams-intelligence in the DigitalT3 tenant
  (Application (client) ID: 1e9e359c-8cd0-4554-9cfd-552d837bd7a8).
- Added the delegated Microsoft Graph permission ChannelMessage.Read.All.
- Attempted to grant tenant-wide admin consent directly -- blocked: my
  account does not hold an Entra ID role with rights to grant consent
  (confirmed via Entra ID > Roles and administrators; the "Grant admin
  consent" control is disabled for my account).

Status: BLOCKED, pending admin action. Consent request sent to PD on
2026-09-15, asking them to grant admin consent for the above app/permission.

Alternatives considered: Option B (application permission) -- not pursued,
since Option A remains viable pending consent and carries materially lower
approval overhead and narrower scope.

Next step once resolved: run a device-code-flow script to fetch one real
Teams channel message via Graph, satisfying CHN-01's acceptance test.

## 2026-09-15 -- LLM response cache: flat files, not SQLite

Decision: Cache LLM responses as individual JSON files on disk, keyed by a SHA-256 hash of the full request, rather than a SQLite table.

Context/reasoning: SPN-04 (the SQLite schema) hasn't been built yet and SPN-02 has no dependency on it. Flat files keep the gateway self-contained and testable in isolation now; this can be revisited once the schema exists if a table turns out to be preferable (e.g. for querying cache stats).

Alternatives considered: Waiting to build the cache until after SPN-04 -- rejected, since SPN-02 is on the critical path and gains nothing by blocking on schema work it doesn't need.

## 2026-09-15 -- Scripts bootstrap sys.path manually

Decision: Each script in scripts/ inserts src/ onto sys.path at the top before importing p1, rather than relying on the editable install's .pth resolution.

Context/reasoning: `uv run python scripts/seed.py` failed with ModuleNotFoundError for p1 even though pip list shows it installed -- traced to unreliable .pth processing in this environment (see the earlier pytest pythonpath fix). This keeps scripts working regardless of that, and regardless of the shell's PYTHONPATH state.

Alternatives considered: Fixing the editable install directly (uv sync --reinstall-package p1) -- already tried, did not resolve it; not worth further time given a working, portable alternative exists.

## 2026-09-17 -- CHN-07: sheet 06's 15 planted difficulties are authoritative, not "twenty"

Decision: Rebuild CHN-07's planted-difficulty fixtures to match source sheet
06 (Seed Data and Planted Difficulties) exactly -- 15 named P1 categories --
rather than the 20 categories originally built.

Context/reasoning: Sheet 06 is the only source sheet that itemizes the P1
planted difficulties in enough detail to build and grade against. Three
other sheets (the sheet guide, the schedule, and the eval plan) reference
"twenty planted difficulties" with no supporting list -- an unreconciled
approximation, not a second specification. The original CHN-07 build had
20 categories that did not cleanly correspond to sheet 06's 15: 4 matched
correctly, 2 needed timing verification, 4 were built as the wrong test
(exact-boundary post instead of one-minute-late; a 3-person thread instead
of one member's reply-only update; emoji-text messages instead of true
silence for a reactions-only member; and the departed-tenant-member case
had its roster/membership direction backwards), 4 were missing entirely
(posting on behalf of another, an @mention that's actually a question, a
labelled channel-silent-day, and a configured non-working day distinct
from a calendar weekend), and 3 were extras not in sheet 06 at all
(duplicate double-post, cross-channel identity, mismatched timezone --
the last of these isn't a "difficulty" at all, since the timezone
difference is already normal CHN-06 config diversity).

Actions taken:
- Rewrote scripts/generate_seed_fixtures.py's planted-difficulty section
  to implement exactly sheet 06's 15 categories (20 label rows total,
  since bot_post/edited_message/deleted_message each carry 2-3 instances
  so the eval harness's precision/recall numbers are meaningful rather
  than a coin flip on a single example).
- Added SKIP_ORGANIC_AUTHOR_ON_DAY to the generator so the deleted-
  message, thread-reply-only, and late-post cases are deterministically
  guaranteed to be each subject's sole activity that day, rather than
  relying on the random seed to avoid a collision.
- Added a new ChannelConfig field, non_working_dates (list[date], default
  empty), plus migration 0003_channel_config_non_working_dates.sql and
  the matching loader.py sync, to represent a one-off configured holiday
  on an otherwise-working weekday -- something working_days (a recurring
  Mon-Fri pattern) cannot express on its own. Applied to proj-alpha.yaml
  (2025-06-13).
- Corrected the departed-tenant-member case's direction: sofia.almeida is
  now on config/channels/proj-beta.yaml's roster (still an expected
  contributor per the system of record) but deliberately absent from
  list_channel_members, rather than the reverse.
- Dropped the 3 out-of-spec categories entirely rather than keeping them
  as an unlabelled "bonus" tier, to avoid recreating the same "does this
  count or not" ambiguity this rework exists to resolve.

Alternatives considered: Keeping 20 and treating the extra 5 as
legitimately specified -- rejected, since no sheet actually specifies what
those 5 would be, and inventing them ourselves would just be a different
unbacked guess. Keeping the 3 out-of-spec categories as clearly-marked
"bonus" cases -- rejected in favour of a clean 15-for-15 match against the
one document that actually specifies this.
